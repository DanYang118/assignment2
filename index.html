            <p>
                I would like to introduce my cat whose name is Gravity. 
				He got this name because he always attracts the whole family to gather around him. 
            </p>
			<p>
             	He loves to snooze in the sun and watch the birds fly around on the balcony. 
				He brings us endless joy and this is a website dedicated to his growth record.
